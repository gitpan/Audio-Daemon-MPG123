Audio::Daemon::MPG123

This is a simple wrapper for Audio::Play::MPG123, I'm pretty
sick of writing documentation, so see the perldocs in the modules
for details.  This is still in beta.

Requires:

for server:
Audio::Play::MPG123 
Audio::Mixer (for optional volume control)


client just needs IO::Socket and IO::Select which should be a default.


INSTALLATION:

perl Makefile.PL
make && make install

see the examples/ directory for examples of how to run a server or client.

The examples/client is crudely interactive (no help in it).
The examples/Server should just work.

Any and all Feedback is welcome.
